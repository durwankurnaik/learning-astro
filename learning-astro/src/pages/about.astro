      <li>
        Just to give you a little brief about me, I am a final year engineering
        student from Pune
      </li>
      <li>
        You probably don't wanna know about my college but it provided me with a
        placement so it is good in that aspect
      </li>
      <li>
        My specialization is in Information Technology because I love to code
      </li>
      <li>I like to build websites and learn as many things as I can</li>
      <li>
        I also love to solve algorithmic problems which leaves me scratching my
        head thinking about the solution
      </li>
